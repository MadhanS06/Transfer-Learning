# Transfer-Learning

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique that leverages knowledge gained from solving one problem and applies it to a different but related problem. It involves using a pre-trained model, typically trained on a large dataset, as a starting point for a new task.

In transfer learning, the idea is to transfer the learned knowledge, such as feature representations, from the pre-trained model to the new model. By doing so, the new model can benefit from the pre-existing knowledge and generalization capabilities of the pre-trained model, even when the new task has a smaller dataset.
